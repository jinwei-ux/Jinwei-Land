                        It was my first 2B project in the industry. <br /><br />What I learned in this project was valuable more practical. I experienced a tight bond in the team work, not only with design team, it was with product managers and engineers. The design team should take care of user experience and also the development cost, meaning we were challenged to design a product both friendly for users and developers. It taught me a new lesson and showed me more responsibilities that a UX designer should take. <br /><br />At last, special thanks to Marvin Cambell, a great mentor and a brilliant product manager in the project. He gave me more than just advice on work, but the spirit that a UX designer could never lack for. Also thanks to Icy Hu, she is a really supportive genius from Comba and gave me great help on the project. I am more than grateful for all the efficiency that every team member put in this great project. It’s us who made this maricle come true.

                        We finally launched our project on 15th October, 2019. Users could register online for faster check-in experience in WMC. This was an evolution that changed the whole check-in systems of exhibition industry. <br /><br />This is a video of how the system worked onsite. <br /><br />Facial recognition technology provided a more user friendly application and could be valuable in more fields. What’s more, after the summit, Vodafone chose facial recognition as access control in their whole office buildings. It is just a beginning, and we believe the applications of biometric identification will have a bright future. <br /><br /><br />

                        The most challenging task in this design was to finish the development of the mobile version without extra working hours, because of the launch date was getting close. It was definitely a nightmare for the frontend engineers. <br /><br />From our side, we must design a development friendly interface to save time and also take care of a coherent user experience. Through the discussion with the development lead and design team, we finally changed the way we put the menu button in uploading page, from side-bar type to top-bar type. In this way we believe it would save at least 80% of the development cost.

                    <div class="thecompatibilityam">
                        The compatibility among different browsers and systems was another huge problem to solve. We designed a contactless experience of taking facial recognition photo, to make this step less privacy concerned. At last we ditched some browsers, like IE, and mainly focused on the popular ones, to balance the cost and the pay. <br /><br />We also changed the font style and the whole layout of the interface, and the final result of both desktop and mobile had great coherency and user experience. <br /><br />Apart from widget, we also gave support to design the onsite check-in machine. It was an Android device, running Sensetime SDK for facial recognition.

                    <div class="theinterfaceonthi">
                        The interface on this device was rather simple and indicative. When the attendee came close, it showed the result of facial recognition, green for pass, orange for stop. If the attendees previously got themselves registered successfully from the widget, they would have green. If no match detected from the database, a orange sign would show. Also a still picture wouldn't be accepted as a live face. While multi-match happened, attendees will be guided to a manual ID check.

                        Through the entrance in the personal information session, we designed a pop-up window to guide the users complete uploading photo. Users needed to confirm two photos for joining the event, facial recognition photo and profile photo, separately for access control use and networking use.

                    <div class="theworkflowinclude">
                        The workflow included two individual parts. When uploading photos, users could choose either from camera or from local files. The photo for facial recognition had extra step for safety concern, which was that users needed to validate that the photo could be recognized as themselves when they check in on-site. <br /><br />We made a connection between facial recognition photo and profile photo. For those users without former profile photo, we provided an option that they could directly use facial recognition photo as profile photo. <br />
                    </div>
                    <div class="whenusersuploadph">
                        When users upload photo from local file, the photo they uploaded would be validated to make sure the quality was good enough for the safe use. We made retristriction for local files, they must be no larger than 5 mb in color and also minimum as 600*600 px. <br /><br />The quality verification process would give feedback to users when they failed to upload a qualified photo. The situations for a failed attempt could be:<br /><br />1. Multiple faces were detected;<br />2. No face was detected;<br />3. Face size in the photo was too small or too big;<br />4. Face occlusion was detected;<br />5. Face was too far away from the center of photo;<br />6. Part of facial feature was missing;<br />7. Mouth open too big;<br /><br />Each case had a specific feedback, helping users upload a qualified photo. After a qualified facial recognition photo was taken or uploaded, users had 4 attempts to validate the photo by comparing the photo with live stream. If they ran out all the attempts, they could choose to try again or reupload the facial recognition photo. Each step was designed to make the check-in process safe and accurate. <br />

Result showed that in users’ mind model, biometric feature belongs to personal information, though it was of great privacy concern, it still was part of the personal information.  <br />

When a specific use case was given, it was proved by the questionnaire that the acceptance rate could be higher than that without a use case shown to the users. And the benefits would be a plus to encourage users to use new method for access control.

                        According to the research, we found out that the situation about privacy concerns varied from region to region. The users in North America and Australia were found to be the most sensitive group regarding posting personal profile picture online, while people in Asia were less worried about personal information on the internet.

                        Facing a more severe situation, the manual check-in process was hard to meet the requirements, even took a great deal of time and money. We redesigned the check-in process with high efficient automatic check-in method, utilising facial recognition technology and camera embedded check-in kiosk, to boost the whole check-in process.
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparingtothetra">
                        Comparing to the traditional check-in methods, the redesigned solution simplified the procedure and turned manual check-in to an automatic way by facial recognition. <br /><br />According to the field research we conducted, manual check-in on average takes 90 seconds to complete the process, including passport scanning, information checking, badge printing, and etc. While automatic check-in method only takes up to 10 seconds, with 1 sec facial recognition and the rest for passing by. It could save up to 80% customer’s waiting time, as well as the cost of counter staff. <br /><br />In order to make the revolution happen, we need to add one extra step during the registration process, which is to collect the facial feature. It indeed took extra time and made the registration process more complicated than it already was. But we believed the magic check-in experience would finally make it all worthwhile. <br /><br />Apart from the refined online registration system, there was another problem that aroused even more attention. The privacy concern would strike an alarm when customers register themselves online. <br /><br />With the publish of GDPR laws in Europe, the private information used online became more sensitive. We were tasked to design a less personal information sensitive interaction for customers from around the world. <br />

                        The old way of check-in was done completely manually by the counter staff. It was time consuming and needed a lot of human resources. We used to work closely with event management company Aventri, with more than 40 lanes in each hall open for attendants. However, the increasing number of attendants made the check-in process boring and redundant. Attendants had to wait for long to get checked and entered the exhibition zone after a long queue. That’s the main problem we needed to challenge. <br />
